# Social Media Feed with Infinite Scrolling

A React-based social media feed application implementing infinite scrolling. The application fetches and displays additional posts as the user scrolls down, optimizing performance for a smooth user experience.

## Features

- Infinite scrolling for dynamic content loading.
- Optimized fetching and rendering of posts.
- Loading spinners to indicate data fetching.
- Error handling and performance optimization.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- React Hooks
- Axios (or Fetch API)
- CSS/SCSS for styling

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-feed.git
   cd social-media-feed

Install the dependencies:

bash

npm install

Start the development server:

bash

npm start

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

# Implementation Details
## 1. Infinite Scrolling in a React Component

Infinite scrolling is implemented using the Intersection Observer API to detect when the user reaches the bottom of the feed. When this occurs, additional posts are fetched and appended to the feed.

## 2. Fetching and Displaying Additional Posts

Posts are fetched from a mock API or backend server using Axios or Fetch API. A useEffect hook triggers the data fetching whenever the observer detects the bottom of the feed.

## 3. Optimizing Performance

To improve performance, we use techniques like lazy loading for images, pagination for fetching posts, and debouncing scroll events to reduce the number of API calls.

## 4. Handling Loading States

A loading spinner is displayed when fetching new posts. The loading state is managed using React state (useState) and controlled via conditional rendering.

## 5. Potential Challenges

+ Over-fetching: Addressed by implementing debouncing and throttling.
+ Performance: Use of virtualized lists to manage large datasets.
